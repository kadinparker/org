\item In the past, I have struggled with keeping my attendance in order, though it is something I have been working on lately. Another thing I might struggle with is communication between myself and my supervisor, due to the fact that I would rather figure things out myself than rely on someone else.
\item I believe I can overcome my attendance issues by keeping myself on a strict sleep schedule. To improve my communication skills with my supervisor, I can make sure to build a friendly relationship so that I feel comfortable sharing information.
