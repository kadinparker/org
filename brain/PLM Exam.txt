Brief Biography
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

◊ Family Members

  ◊ Immediate Family

    ◊ Living with me

      ◊ Mother

        Krista Parker


      ◊ Stepfather

        Jeremy Yourchuk


      ◊ Brother

        Kyran Parker


    ◊ Living with dad

      ◊ Stepmother

        Louise Roy


      ◊ Father

        Christopher Buckton


      ◊ Brothers

        Noah, Nathen and Nolan Buckton-Roy


◊ Friends

  ◊ Alexander Morin

    My best friend, do everything together


◊ Girlfriend

  ◊ Liliana Rhein

    Been together for roughly three years. Plan on living together after
    College/University


◊ Pets

  ◊ Living with me

    ◊ Dogs

      Kiara and Kazer. Kiara is a female yellow lab with infinite
      energy. Once swam across the haviland lake without breaking a
      sweat, had to be picked up in a canoe. Kazer is a male black lab,
      a little more relaxed than his girlfriend. Was attacked by another
      dog, puncturing his back and injuring his knee. Recovered well,
      and is back to running around, albeit a little slower than Kiara.


    ◊ Cat

      We originally had two cats, Toby and Kya. Toby ended up running
      off one day and never came back. Kya is a black/grey cat, very
      cuddly. Will sleep on you if you let her.


  ◊ Living with dad

    ◊ Dogs

      Two little Shiatsu/Pomeranian mixes, both female, love to lick
      peoples faces. When shaved, they look like little teddy bears.


    ◊ Bearded Dragons

      Originally we had 1, then another, then another until we ended up
      with 5 of these funny lizards. Unfortunately, Louise found out
      that she was allergic to them and was forced to give 3 of them
      away. Now only the original (little buddy, who isn't very little
      anymore) and Kevin (the angry one, only lets me pet him some days)
      remain. Love baths and running around chasing the dogs.


    ◊ Fish

      I don't think any of the fish actually have names. Nathen has a
      beta fish, and there is a tank of misc. fish in the living room.
      They are fun to look at, and serve as occasional food for the next
      pet on the list


    ◊ Turtle

      Our turtle, who happens to be named Turtle, spends most of his day
      under his basking lamp. However when he's not basking, he's
      swimming around chasing fish, and looking at you as you walk by
      his tank.


◊ Schools Attended

  ◊ Greenwood Elementary School

    Attended from JK to Grade 6. Enjoyed (most) of my time there, good
    teachers. Still talk to my Grade 6 teacher (Mrs. Wilcox) sometimes
    whenever I pop in to say hello. Moved to the Korah 7/8 program the
    first year it was created, half to escape the bullying that had
    started and half for the computer labs.


  ◊ Korah Collegiate and Vocational School

    Have been attending Korah since Grade 7. Currently enrolled, this
    semester taking Foods, Personal Life Management, Advanced Functions
    and Computer Science. In fact, this is actually an exam for my
    Personal Life Management class, don't tell anybody! Teachers here
    are great, (most of) the people are super nice, and I met my best
    friend (Alex) in grade 7 here.


◊ Sports

  I've tried most sports; Soccer, Baseball, Football, Badminton, however
  the only sport that really ever stuck was Hockey. Started when I was a
  kid, and I've been playing ever since. Next year is my last year,
  excepting College/University hockey. Hopefully going into Midget AA,
  will have to see how I do in drafts.


◊ Personality Traits


◊ Hobbies

  Some of my hobbies include; Computer Programming, Hockey, Video
  Gaming, Biking, and Hiking.


◊ Post Secondary Plans

  Currently up in the air about this, was planning for a while to go
  into the Computer Science course at Algoma U, but recently have been
  exploring the Computer Security field as a future career. Will most
  likely either go to Algoma University or Sault College, for the fact
  that it is cheaper to remain in the city rather than go somewhere else
  for my post secondary.


Famous Quote or Proverb that describes my personality and/or outlook on life
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

        Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of
        it alive. –Elbert Hubbard
  This quote describes my outlook on life fairly well. Take things as
  they come, and it helps me remember that whatever happens today, it
  will seem inconsequential in a few years so why should I stress over
  it?

Human Resources in my life
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

◊ Liliana

  ◊ How do you know them?

    She's my girlfriend, for 3 years.


  ◊ How do they help you?

    She reminds me every day that there are people that care about me,
    and inspires me to achieve any goal that I set for myself.


  ◊ How do you get ahold of them?

    I call her. On the telephone. Or over the internet.


◊ Alexander Morin

  ◊ How do you know them?

    I've known him ever since grade 7, when I moved here (Korah) for the
    7/8 program. Since then we've been (mostly) inseparable, playing
    video games and just hanging out. I also occasionally scribe for
    him, because he has dyslexia, and finds it very hard to write.


  ◊ How do they help you?

    He helps me remember to relax sometimes, unwind over a barbecue
    together and helps me focus on what I want to do in life.


  ◊ How do you get ahold of them?

    Talk to him at school, or call him. On the telephone. Or over the
    internet.


Personal Resources
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

◊ Skills

  "Techy Techy things" Strategist Intelligent Management


◊ Interests

  Coding Video Games Books Music Cool Creepy Things


◊ Health/Fitness

  Reasonably fit, can lift 140+ lbs, which is almost my body weight,
  which is 164 lbs. At 5'11, this gives me a BMI of 22, or with the
  newer SBMI, 37/70. Both of which are in the healthy range. This is
  going to help me as I work towards independence because I wont have to
  worry about increased health risks, and can do more without becoming
  fatigued.
