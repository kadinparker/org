#+TITLE: Modelling with Trigonometric Functions

In previous sections, the horizontal axis of each graph of a trigonometric function was scaled in terms of the irrational number \pi

These scales are not useful in applications where the horizontal axis is usually marked in time intervals

In this section, we will modify the equations of the trigonometric functions so the horizontal axis is marked with whole numbers

* Ex. 1 - Modelling using a Sinusoidal Equation

A weight is supported by a spring. The weight rests 50cm above a table top. The weight is pulled down 25cm and released at time t = 0

This creates a periodic up and down motion. It takes 1.6 seconds for the weight to return to the low position each time

1) Draw a qualitative sketch of the height of the weight above the table top against time.
2) Show the coordinates of some maximum and minimum points and the rest position
3) Create the equation that describes this situation
