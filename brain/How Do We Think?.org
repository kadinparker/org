* The Problem Solving Process
  There are 3 stages in the problem solving process
  # Problem solving is the same as decision making
  - Problem Finding
  - Idea Finding
  - Solution Finding
  It requires both creative-thinking skills and critical-thinking skills
  
* Do you remember?

** Steps to Problem Solving
   - Find the /actual/ problem
   - Think about the problem
   - Generate lots of possible solutions
   - Establish criteria for evaluating ideas
   - Use your criteria for evaluating ideas
   - Rank your ideas and select the best one
   - Try out your idea
   - Is the problem solved? If not, choose another idea and try again
   Use this at the /Problem Finding/ stage
   
* Idea Finding
  Edward De Bono is an expert on creative thinking
  
  According to him there are 6 modes of thinking. To explain his idea, De Bono uses the idea of 6 metaphorical thinking hats that can be put on and taken off at will by the idea creator or problem solver.
  
  The hats are color coded to help people remember which type of thinking is associated with each one

* The Six Thinking Hats

** Objective
   White Hat
   - Concerned with gathering facts, figures, and objective information
   - The white hat thinker should think like a computer
   - "Give me the facts and figures please"
   - "How many? How often? How much?"
   
** Intuitive
   Red Hat
   - Recognizes that emotions and intuition influence thinking
   - Uses hunches and felling to generate info
   - "I have a hunch that..."
   - "This is how I feel about..."

** Creative
   Green Hat
   - Includes thinking using creativity, alternatives and proposals
   - "How else can that be done"

** Negative
   Black Hat
   - Represent the use of judgment and caution
   - Presents a logical case against judgment 

** Positive
   Yellow Hat
   - Also thinks logically, but in very constructive ways
   - Looks for positive outcomes and reasons why the idea will work
   - "I want to explore this further..."

** Process
   Blue Hat
   - Used to pull the other hats together
   - The one who makes things happen
   - "Let's get started..."
