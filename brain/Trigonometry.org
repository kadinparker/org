* Review

Terms that we used when dealing with Trig:

- Angles in standard position
- Terminal arm
- Special triangles
- Co-terminal angles
- Period
- Amplitude

We also look at transformations:

for example: \(y = a \cdot sin(k(x-d)) + c\)

Period::One Cycle
Amplitude::Distance from axis to max

\(\theta = \frac{a}{r} = \frac{r}{r} = 1\)

How many degrees are in 1 radian?

\(57.3\degree\)

We are often expressing angles as real numbers, without units, in terms of \(\pi\)

\(\pi\) radians = \(180\degree\)

** Convert each of the following to radians.

a) \(30\degree\) \((\frac{\pi}{180\degree})\)\\
= \(\frac{30\pi}{180}\)\\
= \(\frac{\pi}{6}\)

b) \(40\degree(\frac{\pi}{180\degree}\)\\
=

** Convert each radian measure to degrees

a) \(\frac{3\pi}{4}(\frac{180}{\pi})\)\\
= \(135\degree\)

b) 1.5 radians \((\frac{180}{\pi})\)\\
= \(85.9\degree\)

* Transformations of Trigonometric Functions

Remember our rules for transforming ANY function:

\((x,y) \rightarrow (\frac{x}{k} + d, ay + c)\)

** Need to Know

The parameters in the equations \(f(x) = a \cdot sin(k(x-d)) + c\) and \(f(x) = a \cdot cos(k(x-d)) + c\) give useful information about transformations and characteristics of the function.
