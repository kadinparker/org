\label{sec:org23660a7}
There are 3 stages in the problem solving process

\begin{itemize}
\item Problem Finding
\item Idea Finding
\item Solution Finding
\end{itemize}
It requires both creative-thinking skills and critical-thinking skills

\subsection*{Steps to Problem Solving}
\label{sec:orgfec5a81}
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the \emph{actual} problem
\item Think about the problem
\item Generate lots of possible solutions
\item Establish criteria for evaluating ideas
\item Use your criteria for evaluating ideas
\item Rank your ideas and select the best one
\item Try out your idea
\item Is the problem solved? If not, choose another idea and try again
\end{itemize}
Use this at the \emph{Problem Finding} stage


\section*{Idea Finding}
\label{sec:orgc36e320}
Edward De Bono is an expert on creative thinking

According to him there are 6 modes of thinking. To explain his idea, De Bono uses the idea of 6 metaphorical thinking hats that can be put on and taken off at will by the idea creator or problem solver.

The hats are color coded to help people remember which type of thinking is associated with each one
