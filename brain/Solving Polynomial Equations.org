* Note

To solve an equation

Solve $x^4+9x^3+21x^2-x-30=0$

f(1) = 0

/Do synthetic division here/

$(x-1)(x^3+10x^2+31x+30)=0$

f(-2) = 0

/Do synthetic division here/

(x-1)(x+2)(x^2+8x+15)=0

(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+5)=0

x = 1
x = -2
x = -3
x = -5

Sometimes, there will be no solution (even degree):

If it is an odd degree, it /will/ have a zero
