* Sigmund Freud
  Father of Psychoanalysis

** The Psyche
   Human mind divided into 3 areas:
   
*** Id
    - Unconscious
    - Irrational
    - Based on raw, primal instinct
    - Libido or "drive" for food, water and sex
    - Does not think -- it acts
    - Innate -- no experience -- does not learn
    - *the pleasure principle* -- needs to be regulated
    - Evolution

*** Superego
    - Subconscious or preconscious
    - Moral / Judicial branch of personality
    - Ethics, values, and rules
    - Shaped by parents, society, culture, religion
    - Idealism -- not reality
    - Socialization and Cultural Tradition

      Ego Ideal represents all that is morally good -- "Smile"

      Conscience represents all that is morally bad -- "Don't frown"

*** Ego
    - Conscious -- it is your personality
    - Regulates /id/ and /superego/
    - Seeks balance between the /id/ and the real world
    - Perception, memory, thinking
    - Common sense acquired through experience
    - *The reality principle*
    - Interaction with Reality / Learning
   
*** Literary Applications
    Authors create characters who are of "two minds"

    - The character _*knows*_ what is right but is compelled to do wrong
    - In cartoons, we see the angel and devil on opposite shoulders
    - Authors also create characters who represent _*parts*_ of the psyche

    Lord of the Flies

    - Jack
      - Irrational, primal, libido, action / not words
    - Piggy
      - Rational, moral, ethical, historical, rule-driven
    - Ralph
      - Balanced, democratic, realistic, experienced

**** Examples
     - Macbeth's decision to murder King Duncan in /Macbeth/
