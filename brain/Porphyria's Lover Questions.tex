\maketitle
\tableofcontents

\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item A poem in the form of a speech or narrative by an imagined person, in which the speaker inadvertently reveals aspects of their character while describing a particular situation or series of events.
\item Telling us the story of what happened, tells us details of the fling
\end{enumerate}
\item The narrator is Porphyria's Lover. His mental state isn't very good, he kills Porphyria to freeze everything in time.
\item Porphyria is in a higher class socially, which is the reason they can't be together. This helps understand the poem, because we can see a motive behind why Porphyria can't be with him.
\item "Passion sometimes would prevail"
\item Can't stay because of social class
\item Yellow hair -- Sunshine, warm, caring
\end{enumerate}
