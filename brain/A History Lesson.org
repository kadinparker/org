  - Industrial Age 
    - A period where people began to build equipment they could use to produce standardized goods in large quantities
  - The equipment was too big and heavy to carry around (and expensive), for the first time the people who produced the goods were no longer self-employed, but laborers
  - Organizations were formed to produce goods and services
  - Their assets included capital investments, and the intangible asset of goodwill
  - Most operated under the command and control model
  - In the late 18th and early 20th century workers began to form _trade unions_
  
* The Age of the Middle Class
  - Post WWII saw North American companies expand exponentially
  - Wages grew
    - People made a good living working for others
  - Enrollment in post secondary education soared
  - Interstate highways and trans-Canada highway made population much more mobile
  - Jet age
  
* A period of transition 
  - More women graduated in late 60's early 70's
  - Women's movement -- more women working
  - Pressure on labour markets
  - Loss of union influence over the last few decades
  - People relying on alternative forms of incone -- entrepreneurship

* The Information Age
  - The new economy has ushered in the information age
  - Information is not dependant on expensive equipment and large factories, but is readily available to anyone who wants it
  - Those who will succeed are those who seek out new information, or new ways of handling information and turning into something practical
