"This is Echo 1 to control, copy." His voice was dotted with static over the planet's comms system.
"Echo 1 this is control, we copy, over." Came the reply from control, the central command center on this planet.
"Control, we have succesfully found the crevace indicated on our mission statement. Permission to proceed, over."
"Permission granted Echo 1. Be careful down there. Out." With a soft click, the comms connection between control and Echo 1 was severed. He shuddered nervously.
"Feeling nervous?" Came a smooth voice over his private comms channel. He looked to his left, seeing his partner, Echo 2, looking rather nice in her Planetary Exploration Hazmat and Survival Suit. No one ever called it that though, it was always called the KMS. Standing both for what it did, Keeps Me Safe, and what you would be doing if you took it off, Killing My Self.
"Not at all" he shot back, obviously nervous. "We should get going, we're burning daylight here"
"The day are 865 years long, we could stand here until we die and it would still be daylight." She scoffed at him, shooting him a smirk. "But if you insist, we can get moving. Have the mission statement?"
"Locate and analyze new species of flora in the newly discovered crevace on this planet." He read off his HUD, for the 20th time in the last 10 minutes. Not that she knew that.
"Sounds easy enough, let's go." and she clipped onto the safety tether and began descending into the dark embrace of the crevace, smiling to herself as she listened to Echo 1 muttering to himself about it being easy, and following her.

"I believe I found something." Echo 1 stated, both through his private comms and to his onboard journal.
"What is it?" Echo 2 asked, walking over from where she was searching, looking to see what he was talking about.
"It looks like some sort of vine."
